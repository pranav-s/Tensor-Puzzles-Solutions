# Tensor Puzzles Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to puzzles found in the [Tensor Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles) repository.


## Introduction

Tensor Puzzles is a repository from Sasha Rush that has a range of puzzles that ask you to reimplement certain standard functions in Numpy/PyTorch with the added constraints that they may only be constructed using arange, where and other functions previously defined in the repo. It is a great exercise in thinking through the matrix arithmetic or indexing logic that lies behind these functions.

## Puzzle Solutions

The solutions to the puzzles can be found in the following notebook:

- [Puzzle Solutions Notebook](Tensor Puzzlers.ipynb)

Alternative solutions are provided in some cases inside the function body in comments. I have experimented with some possible solutions in cells after the body of each puzzle which may or may not be relevant to the final solution as they are things I was just trying out. I am keeping them in the repo in the hopes that it maybe useful to others doing experiments of their own. You can also check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hafo7hIl8MU) YouTube video in which Sasha discusses the solutions to each puzzle in the repo.

The notebook was run using Google Colab.
